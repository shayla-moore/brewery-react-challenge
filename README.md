# Brewery ReactJS Project
## Introduction
The aim of this project was to create a single page application using React to display a list of breweries with the ability to click on an item from the list to view more details on that brewery. My personal aim was also to learn ReactJs/JavaScript as this is my first ReactJs/JavaScript project.

[Here is the Application which is hosted on Heroku](https://react-brewery-challenge.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies
- ReactJs
- SCSS (A popular Sass Syntax for styling)
- Gulp (Builds SCSS files into CSS)
- Heroku (Used for hosting purposes)

## Illustrations
### The Main Page
![Main Page](https://i.imgur.com/AIVRKqT.jpg)
The main page lists the breweries in Card components. When more Cards are on the screen than the page can possible fit, the page allows vertical scrolling.

### Brewery Information
![Card Component](https://i.imgur.com/jOqS7BE.jpg)

A close up of a Brewery Card initially just shows the Brewery name, but upon pressing the "Find Out More" Button, more information is revealed such as: 

- The Type of Brewery
- The Brewery Address
- The Brewery Website which Opens in a New Tab
- A link to the location of the Brewery on a Google Map

### Google Maps Page

When the "Find this Brewery on a Map" link is clicked, a page with the Brewery on a Google Map is provided within the application. The user can zoom in and zoom out as they please. A link to go back to the main page is also provided.
**API key Removed for the Public Repo**

## Future To-Do's
- Learning more ways to style the SCSS and ReactJs properly as this is my first ReactJs project
- Provide Code Testing and Learn the best way to do it.
